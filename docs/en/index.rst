VLMEvalKit Getting Started Guide
-------------------------------

To help users get started quickly, we recommend the following process:

- For users who want to use VLMEvalKit, we recommend reading the "Start Your First Step" section to set up the environment and start a mini-experiment to familiarize yourself with the process.

- If you want to customize more modules, such as adding datasets and models, we provide an "Advanced Tutorial."

We always welcome users' PRs (Pull Requests) and Issues to improve VLMEvalKit!

"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day\nShe eats 3 eggs for breakfast\nThis leaves 16 - 3 = 13 eggs to sell\nEach egg sells for $2\nSo she makes 13 * $2 = $26 per day\n\nThe answer is $26. I hope it is correct."
"Total labor cost = 3 workers * $20 per hour * 40 hours = $2,400\nRevenue from job = $5,400\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nProfit = $5,400 - $2,400 = $3,000\n\nThe answer is $3,000. I hope it is correct."
"Steve has 8 marbles\nJohn has 3 less than Steve, so John has 8 - 3 = 5 marbles\nSam has 5 times as many as John\nSo Sam has 5 × 5 = 25 marbles\n\nThe answer is 25. I hope it is correct."
"Tom is baking cookies. One batch makes 12 cookies and needs 2.5 cups of flour\nTo make 60 cookies, Tom needs 60 ÷ 12 = 5 batches\nEach batch needs 2.5 cups of flour\nTotal flour needed = 5 × 2.5 = 12.5 cups\n\nThe answer is 12.5. I hope it is correct."
"The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nThe answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct."
"We have that $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \\boxed{24}$.\nThe answer is $24$. I hope it is correct."
"If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight. If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight. Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\nThe answer is $16$. I hope it is correct."
"If we multiply the first equation by $-\\frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$, we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\nThe answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct."

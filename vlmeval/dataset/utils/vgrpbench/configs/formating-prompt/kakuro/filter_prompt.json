We want to fill in the grid with numbers 1 to 4 such that each row and column adds up to the specified sum. We also want to avoid having adjacent numbers be the same. This is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem. Our goal is to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints. We can start by analyzing the given information and looking for any patterns or clues that can help us narrow down the possible solutions. For example, in the first row, the sum is 12 and the middle cell is empty. This means that the sum of the two adjacent cells must be 12. If we try different combinations, we can see that the only possibility is 3 + 9 = 12. Similarly, in the second row, the sum is 14 and the middle cell is empty. This means that the sum of the two adjacent cells must be 14. If we try different combinations, we can see that the only possibility is 4 + 10 = 14. We can continue this process for each row and column to find the possible values for the empty cells. Once we have found the possible values for each cell, we can use constraint propagation to eliminate any impossible values and narrow down the search space. Finally, we can use a backtracking search algorithm to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints.\", \n\"answer\": [[3, 9, 12, 10], [1, 4, 2, 14], [7, 3, 1, 4], [4, 3, 2, 11]]}"

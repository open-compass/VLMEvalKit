Empty cells will be represented by '*'.\nThen, I need to apply the Binairo rules to fill the empty cells.\nThe rules are:\n1. No more than two adjacent cells can have the same color.\n2. Each row and column must have an equal number of black and white cells.\n\nLet's represent the initial state of the grid.\nRow 0: *, *, *, b\nRow 1: w, *, *, *\nRow 2: *, b, w, *\nRow 3: b, *, *, w\n\nNow, let's apply the rules to fill the empty cells.\n\n**Step 1:** Analyze row 0. It has one 'b'. It needs one more 'b' and two 'w'.\n**Step 2:** Analyze row 1. It has one 'w'. It needs one more 'w' and two 'b'.\n**Step 3:** Analyze row 2. It has one 'b' and one 'w'.

So the cell at (0,2) cannot be 'b'.\nIn row 3, the first cell is 'b'. So the cell at (3,1) cannot be 'b'.\n\nConsider row 0: *, *, *, b. If the second to last cell is 'b', we have *, *, b, b.

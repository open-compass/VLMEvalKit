The weights increase from left to right (for rows) and top to bottom (for columns), starting from 1. Indexing starts at 0.\n\n**Current Game State**\n\nThe current game state is represented as a 2D array:\n\n```json\n{\"perception\": [[\"1,1\",\"1,2\",\"3\",\"7\",\"1\",\"4\"], [\"2,1\",\"2,2\",\"2,3\",\"2,4\",\"3,1\",\"3,4\",\"4,1\",\"4,2\",\"4,3\",\"4,4\"]]}\n```\n\n**Thinking Process**\n\nTo solve this problem, I will use a systematic approach to try different combinations of shaded cells.\n\n*   Start with the first row and try to find a combination of shaded cells that satisfies the weight constraint.\n*   Move to the second row and try to find a combination of shaded cells that satisfies the weight constraint.\n*   Repeat the process for all rows.\n*   Once all rows are satisfied, move to the columns and repeat the process.\n*   Continue this process until all constraints are satisfied or it becomes clear that there is no solution.\n\n**Solution**\n\nAfter trying different combinations, I found a solution that satisfies all constraints:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": [[\"s\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\"],[\"e\",\"e\",\"s\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\"],[\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"s\",\"e\",\"e\"],[\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"s\",\"e\"],[\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"s\"],[\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\"]]}\n```\n\nThis solution satisfies all constraints and is a valid solution to the Kakurasu puzzle.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe solution to the Kakurasu puzzle is a 2D array where each cell is either shaded (s) or unshaded (e). The shaded cells are located in the first, third, and fifth rows, as well as in the fourth and sixth columns. This solution satisfies all constraints and is a valid solution to the puzzle."
